# Ask Matt

You don't remember every skill, so ask.

Before stating what a skill does or recommending a step be skipped, read that skill's SKILL.md: the summaries here are for orientation only.

A **flow** is a path through the skills. Most paths run along one **main flow**, and two **on-ramps** merge onto it. Everything else is standalone, or a vocabulary layer that runs underneath.

## The main flow: idea → ship

The route most work travels. You have an idea and want it built.

1. **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens the idea by interview. Start here whenever you are **working in a working directory**: it's stateful, opening the feature task before its first write and retaining what it learns in `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs in that checkout. It runs `/grilling` and `/domain-modeling`, then calls `/to-spec` once the frontier is empty and you confirm the shared understanding, ending in a spec and tickets.
2. **Branch: can you settle every question in conversation?** If a question needs a runnable answer (state, business logic, a UI you have to see), detour through a prototype before you confirm the shared understanding, bridged by **`/handoff`** in both directions (a prototype lives in its own directory, which is exactly what `/handoff` is for; see Phase boundaries):
   - **`/handoff`** out, then open a fresh session against that file,
   - **`/prototype`** to answer the question with throwaway code,
   - **`/handoff`** back what you learned, and reference it from the original idea thread.
3. **Branch: one small task or a feature with tickets?**
   - **Feature with tickets** → **`/to-spec`** turns the thread into a spec and tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its **blocking edges** and **Seams**. `/grill-with-docs` already calls it at the end; from another conversation or a finished map, invoke it directly. **`/implement-spec`** reads the tickets as a **task graph**, runs implementer subagents across the ready **frontier** in parallel, and settles their ticket tasks into the feature branch itself.
   - **Small change** → **`/implement`** works one task straight to `main`, without a written spec if the conversation already settled the work. A bug fix after `/diagnosing-bugs` takes this same route in its own task.

   Both build through **`/tdd`** (one red-green slice at a time), commit through git-workflow's commit route, and invoke **`/code-review`**, the two-axis review (Standards + Spec), against the task's base commit. `/implement-spec` runs its review over the whole feature after every ticket has settled. Reach for **`/tdd`** on its own for a concrete behaviour test-first, and **`/code-review`** on its own to review a committed diff against a fixed point.

   The feature stays off `main` until review fixes and `/retro` are done, `task-complete` has run, and the operator's primary session runs the printed `task-settle-plan`/`task-settle-apply` route. Publishing is a separate operator request, through `publish-push-plan`/`publish-push-apply`.

4. **`/retro`** closes the loop. After a build, and especially one that went sideways, it looks back over the session and suggests changes to the agent's **environment**, not the code: navigation pointers, automated checks, the coding standards `/code-review` enforces, steering files, tooling. Mechanical mistakes become deterministic checks; judgement calls become coding standards. The next build then starts from a better environment.

### Context hygiene

Keep steps 1–3 in **one unbroken context window** (don't compact or clear until after `/to-spec`) so the grilling, spec, and tickets all build on the same thinking. Each ticket implementer then starts fresh in its own task checkout, working from the ticket. Run `/retro` in the session it's looking back on, before you clear; after clearing, point it at that session's log instead.

The limit on this is the **[smart zone](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/smart-zone)**: the window (~150k tokens on state-of-the-art models) within which the model still reasons sharply. If a session approaches it before `/to-spec`, don't push on degraded; `/compact` at the nearest phase boundary and carry on (see Phase boundaries).

## On-ramps

A starting situation that generates work, then merges onto the main flow.

- **Bugs and requests piling up** → **`/triage`**. It moves issues through triage roles and produces agent-ready issues, which **`/implement`** later picks up.

  Triage is only for issues **you didn't create**: bug reports, incoming feature requests, anything that arrives raw. Tickets that `/to-spec` produced are already agent-ready, so **don't triage them**.

- **Something's broken** → **`/diagnosing-bugs`**. For the hard ones: the bug that resists a first glance, the intermittent flake, the regression that crept in between two known-good states. It refuses to theorise until it has a **tight feedback loop** (one command that already goes red on *this* bug), then hands the diagnosed fix to **`/implement`** in its own task targeting `main`, with a regression test. Once the fix is in, run **`/retro`** in the same session to ask what would have prevented the bug; where the real finding is that there's no good seam to lock it down, that's a job for **`/improve-codebase-architecture`**.

- **A huge, foggy effort: a greenfield project or a huge feature build, too big for one session** → **`/wayfinder`**, the most cognitively demanding flow here. When the way from here to the destination isn't visible yet, it charts a **shared map** of **decision tickets** on the issue tracker and resolves them one at a time, producing **decisions, not deliverables**, until the fog is pushed back and the way is clear. Where **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens an idea you can hold in one session, wayfinder is for the idea you can't, and it's slower and denser, so save it for exactly that, never a well-scoped feature.

  When the map clears, **it hands off, it doesn't build**: merge onto the main flow at **`/to-spec`**, which collapses the map's linked decisions into a buildable spec and its tickets, then `/implement-spec` for its tickets. Looping the map straight into `/implement` skips that collapse and throws the linked detail away, so go straight to `/implement` only when the effort turned out genuinely small.

## Codebase health

Not feature work, just upkeep.

- **`/improve-codebase-architecture`** runs whenever you have a spare moment to keep the codebase good for agents to operate in. It surfaces **deepening opportunities**; picking one _generates an idea_ you can take into the main flow at `/grill-with-docs`. It's the survey that finds the candidates; **`/codebase-design`** (below) is the bench you design the chosen one on.

## Vocabulary underneath

Two model-invoked references that run *beneath* the other skills, each the single source of truth for its vocabulary. Reach for them directly when the **words**, not the process, are the problem; or let the skills above pull them in.

- **`/domain-modeling`**: sharpen the project's *domain* language: challenge a fuzzy term, resolve an overloaded word ("account" doing three jobs), record a hard-to-reverse decision as an ADR. It's the active discipline `/grill-with-docs` drives to keep `GLOSSARY.md` a clean glossary.
- **`/codebase-design`** is the deep-module vocabulary (module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality) for designing a module's *shape*: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface at a clean seam. `/tdd` and `/improve-codebase-architecture` both speak it.

## Phase boundaries

A **phase** is a chunk of work inside a session: the grilling, the implementation, the QA. At the **boundary** between two of them you have five options, and picking between them is the fuzziest decision in this whole map:

- **Continue**: stay put. Costs nothing, loses nothing.
- **`/clear`**: empty the window, when nothing here matters to what's next.
- **`/handoff`** writes a portable markdown file. Narrow: only for a **new harness**, a **new directory**, a **colleague**, or forking a side task **mid-phase**. What it buys is portability.
- **Subagent**: send a tightly-scoped task to its own window and get a report back.
- **`/compact`** compresses this context and seeds a fresh session with it. The **default**, at the bottom of the tree rather than the first reach.

Read [PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md](PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md) for the ordered tree: the five questions, the reasoning behind each branch, and why the primary-source cost makes **Continue** the one to rule out first. Make the decision **at** a boundary; mid-phase, continue or split the rest into subagents.

## Standalone

Off the main flow entirely.

- **`/grilling`** is the interview primitive itself: rounds, the frontier, facts are the agent's job and decisions are yours. `/grill-with-docs` is the user-invoked way in, and `/triage`, `/wayfinder` and `/improve-codebase-architecture` all run it internally. Reach for it directly only when you want the interview with no wrapper around it.
- **`/prototype`** is a small, throwaway program that answers one design question: does this state model feel right, or what should this UI look like. Throwaway is a constraint on how the code is written, not a promise to destroy it: the answer folds into the real code, and the prototype itself is kept as a **primary source** on its own retained task branch out of main, with its worktree retired, pointed at from the implementation issue. It's the detour in step 2 of the main flow, but reach for it any time a design question is hard to settle on paper.
- **`/research`**: delegate reading legwork to a **background agent**: it investigates a question against **primary sources**, then returns its findings for this session to file in the feature checkout. Keep working while it reads. The file it produces is something to take *into* the main flow at `/grill-with-docs`, since research feeds the thinking rather than replacing it.
- **`/to-questionnaire`** comes in when the thing blocking you isn't in your head or the codebase but in **someone else's**, and it writes them a questionnaire to fill in. It's the inverse of the grilling interview: instead of interviewing you about the subject, it interviews you about the **send** (who it's going to, what you need back) and aims the questions at the gap. What comes back is material for `/grill-with-docs` or `/to-spec`.
- **`/wizard`** is for the steps only a **human** can take: provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, clicking through an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, running a one-off migration or cutover. It generates an interactive bash script that opens each URL, captures each value, and writes it into `.env` and GitHub secrets, so the procedure stops being something you re-explain to an agent every time. Model-invoked, so the agent reaches for it the moment it hits a wall only you can pass. If the agent could just do it itself, it should; this is for where a human is genuinely in the loop.
- **`/wait-what`** is the corrective for a message that didn't land. Use it mid-conversation, inside any other skill, and the agent re-pitches what it just said with the context you were missing, in plain English, using the `GLOSSARY.md` vocabulary. It works after the fact; `/grill-with-docs` is the upfront cure, because a shared language agreed early is what stops the jargon arriving at all.
- **`/teach`**: learn a concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful workspace.
- **`/writing-for-agents`** is the reference for writing documents agents consume: skills, AGENTS.md, pointed-at docs.

## Task shape and stage checks

Read the project's agent instructions, especially the **Issue tracker** section written by project-init, and follow its tracker path. That path locates the spec and tickets; do not substitute a scratch directory for durable planning files.

| Situation | Route and Git stage |
| --- | --- |
| First feature write in `/grill-with-docs`, `/wayfinder`, or `/to-spec` from a plain conversation | The skill starts one feature task from the primary checkout, binds its run and continues there. Glossary, decisions, spec, tickets, code, review fixes and retro share that branch. |
| Small change, unrelated fix during a feature, or bug fix after `/diagnosing-bugs` | `/implement` in its own task targeting `main`. Its step 1 checks the checkout, open task and bound run before writing. |
| Feature with tickets | `/implement-spec` in the feature checkout checks the open feature, bound run and spare capacity. It starts each ticket with `task-start --base-ref <feature-branch>` and checks that base and integration target before launching its implementer. |

## Precondition

**`/setup-matt-pocock-skills`**: run before your first engineering flow to configure the issue tracker, triage labels, and doc layout the other skills assume. Custom issue trackers also work.
